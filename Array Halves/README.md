Chef has a permutation 
P
P of length 
2
⋅
N
2⋅N. He can perform the following operation on 
P
P:

Select an index

 .
Chef would call the permutation 
P
P good, if the maximum element of the first half of 
P
P is less than the minimum element of the second half of 
P

Note: A permutation of length 
N
N is an array where every integer from 
1
1 to 
N
N occurs exactly once.

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer 
T
T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer 
N
N — half the size of the permutation 
P

]
→
[
